### Projects:

[Project 1: Cleaning Data in SQL Queries](https://github.com/jigme342/My_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/SQL%20Data%20Cleaning.sql)

In this project, I demonstrated my expertise in data cleaning by meticulously addressing challenges within a Nashville housing dataset using SQL queries. From populating missing property addresses to organizing data into structured columns and eliminating duplicate entries, I showcased a keen eye for detail and proficiency in SQL to ensure data integrity and usability for further analysis.

[Project 2: EXploring COVID-19 Data with SQL](https://github.com/jigme342/My_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/SQL%20Data%20Exploration.sql)

 In this project, I leveraged SQL's analytical capabilities to delve into COVID-19 datasets from various sources. With SQL queries, I computed critical metrics such as mortality rates and infection prevalence, comparing them against population demographics to identify regions of concern. Through meticulous analysis, I provided valuable insights crucial for informed decision-making in the face of the global health crisis.

[Project 3: Using SQL String Functions to Clean Data](https://github.com/jigme342/My_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Using%20SQL%20string%20functions%20to%20clean%20data.sql)

 In this project, I harnessed SQL's string functions to refine textual data, exemplifying my technical prowess and attention to detail. By employing functions to determine string lengths, extract relevant substrings, and manipulate text case, I optimized data cleaning and transformation processes. This project exemplifies my ability to leverage SQL's capabilities to enhance data quality and streamline workflows for effective data management.
